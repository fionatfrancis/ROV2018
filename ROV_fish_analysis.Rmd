# Preliminary analysis of fish and substrate data from 2018 ROV VECTOR surveys

The goal of this analysis is to look at the distribution of fish (all species and specifically rockfish) along transects collected in targetted rockfish habitat inside and outside RCAs.
We want to:  
1. determine if there is an effect of RCA status on fish densities
2. determine in there is an association between substrate types and fish occurrences

We currently do not have size data for the fish observations from the stereo cameras. This data has been analyzed by WDFW but they are currently in the field and this data during our last email communication (Dec 2020) still needed some groundtruthing. 

An additional data set is in Biigle and consists of video grabs from SD, GoPro, and stereo cameras to compare detectability between the three types of video. These stills have been annotated but have not been sized using laser points. I am going to talk to Jessica about exporting the files cleanly but I (or someone) should also get sizes out of these images so that they can be compared the the stereo data once we get it from WDFW. 

## Basic Information from SD video and fish observations
```{r map, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "RCAs and 2018 Vector ROV transects from QGIS", echo = FALSE}
# include a map image that I saved from QGIS 
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("transects.png"))
```

```{r setup and initial data cleaning, include = FALSE}

## SETUP -----------

#install.packages("tidyverse")
#install.packages("janitor")
library(janitor)
library(tidyverse)
library(fishualize)

# read in csvs
fish <- read_csv("2018_Vector_fish_with_coords.csv")
habitat <-read_csv("ROV2018_Vector_SpeciesData.csv")
status<- read_csv("Station_ID_RCA.csv")
unique(habitat$Species)
unique(fish$Species)
unique(fish$GPS_time)
duplicated(fish$GPS_time)

## FISH OBSERVATIONS DATA CLEANING -----

#after ground truthing some of the duplicate rows by watching the videos I am changing the count of quillback on survey H119 at 08:11:17 from 2 to 1 in each of the two duplicated rows. Doing this in here so that there is a record and it can be changed back.

habitat <-habitat %>% mutate(Count = replace(Count, SurveyID == "H119-CA-V" & Species == "Quillback rockfish" & MicroSub1 == "R", 1))

fish <- fish %>% mutate(SurveyID = sub("Exp", "Explore", SurveyID))

#add columns from habitat to fish to circumvent problem outlined below

## combine the two datasets so that we have habitat and fish together, need to merge by survey, time and species because
#you can have more than one species at any given time (i.e. multiple species in the same frame). 
  #nope this also doesn't work because species at the same time are written in a differetn order in each dataset
  #for some reason

# Transects with no fish -----------------------------
# from looking at transect lines and fish observations in qgis there are 4 transects that don't seem to have fish  but a couple of them are listed in this dataset namely H113, H052, and L029. H044 is also showing no fish but it isn't in this dataset so maybe it is acutally the only one with no fish? What about H063_P1? I don't think that that has any fish in qgis? oh it is just P1 that has no fish but P2 does and so the overall H063 has fish. Need to deal with this in the widths then? Where is the info for H107?? I can't find the transect in QGIS either?? Also H069 has no fish in qGIS. I think H044 and H069 both have data but had no fish. need to ask Dana how to add these in?

# I need to calculate the area of each transect so that I can calculate a density of fish on each one. The simple way to do this would be to take the total distance of the transect and multiple it by the average width pf the lasers (width was measured every 20 seconds). However, it would be nice to be able to calculate the areas every 30 seconds instead. This requires knowing the trackline for that 30 seconds and then drawing a polygon of the appropriate width around that thrack line and summing all of the track line 30 segments up. We know the position of the track every 1 second so should be able to draw a line over these using the sp and rgeos packages according to J. Nephin. The plan is to give each segment of 30 second GPS coordinate an individual ID that we then turn into a line segment using sp. Then I can use the glength funtion in rgeos to calculate the length of this line and can multiply it by the appropriate width. In theory I should be able to make a loop that runs through the ID column, loop through and add a 1 every time that I hit a new date

# let's just plot all of the widths over a transect, there is quite a lot of variation 

ggplot(width) + geom_point(aes(SurveyID, actual.width),alpha = 0.4)

# hmm but there are 400 missing widths so what do I do with those? There is a lot of variation within a transect but ALL the transects have a lot of variation so maybe it's just worth taking the overall distance and widths for now and worry about this later if I need to?

# okay we need to summarize the areas for each indiviudal transect before we merge them with the fish data because some of the segments didn't have fish so if we merge if first the area that then gets totaled won't be the whole transect just the segments that have fish observations which is not correct. We need to add in the whole transect area as a column so that we can then calculate the fish density over the entire area searched. This is still not going to account for transects where no fish were seen though becuase those zeros are not in the fish dataset.

```{r, calculating % substrates, include = FALSE}
#SUBSTRATE

#DFO measured habitat continuously in their transects (so everytime the habitat changed they recorded that change you so you could calculate the area of each habitat type). The WDFW records the habitat every 30 seconds instead so you really only get these point measures (because habitat could have changed several times in each segment). So I am going to calucate the % habitat of each transect simply by treating each measure as a sample point (e.g. if there were 40, 30 second segments that is 40 habitat measures) and then dividing each type by the total (e.g. 3 records of rock would be 3/40 as the % of rock on that transect) Does this make sense?

#Count of substrate 1 per surveyID divided by the total number of records of substrate in that SurveyID but need to do this with the width data csv not the all.data dataframe (because that only has the habitats associated with fish)

```
Data were collected around `r length(unique(status$NAME))` RCAS.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
list(unique(status$NAME))
```

There are  `r length(unique(all.data$SurveyID))` transects that have fish observations. There were (`r status %>% filter(RCA == "OUT") %>% count(RCA) `) outside of RCAs and (`r status %>% filter(RCA == "IN") %>% count(RCA) `) inside RCAs collected overall. From looking at data files such as the substrate data there are actually `r length(unique(substrate$Survey.abbrv))` transects total but I think that some of these were messed up so not used. There are two transects (H044 and H069) that I think were fine (there is width and lenght data) but there were zero fish on them sp they do not show up in the master fish observation csv. I have not yet put these in the dataset but I could just creat rows with zero variable so they get included in the model?  

## BASIC DATA SUMMARIES

Total fish seen in and out of RCAs
``` {r, echo = FALSE}
all.data %>% group_by(RCA) %>% summarise(total = sum(Count))
```

Types of primary substrate and how many times they were observed
``` {r, echo = FALSE}
all.data %>% group_by(Substrate) %>% summarise(total = sum(Count))
```

Number of fish seen by transect
``` {r, echo = FALSE}
all.data %>% group_by(SurveyID) %>% summarise(total = sum(Count))
```
Number of fish of each species across all transects

``` {r, include = FALSE}
fish.counts <- all.data %>% group_by(Species) %>% summarize(total = sum(Count)) %>% arrange(desc(total))
```
``` {r, echo = FALSE}
fish.counts
```

## FISH ABUNDANCES

Some basic plots pooling over all transects. You can see that certain species were seen in clusters and others were usually solitary.

``` {r echo = FALSE}
#the fct_infreq was to order species by count from forcats
ggplot(all.data) + geom_point(aes(fct_infreq(factor(Species)), Count, colour = Count, alpha = 1.4), size = 3, show.legend = F) + 
  scale_color_fish(option = "Gramma_loreto", direction = -1) +  
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  xlab("Species") +
  ylab("Counts")


ggplot(fish.counts) + geom_point(aes(fct_inorder(factor(Species)), total, colour = total), size = 3, show.legend = F) + 
  scale_color_fish(option = "Gramma_loreto", direction = -1) +  
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  xlab("Species") + 
  ylab("Total individuals observed")

```


## TRANSECT AREAS

These were calculated so that we can determine fish densities per transect. I wanted to do this by creating segments along each transect using width measurements every 30 seconds however there were a lot of missing values so I have done this the simple way of taking the total distance of each transect and multiplying it by the average width pf the lasers (width was measured every 30 seconds). 

```{r, echo = F}
print(areas, n = Inf)
```

## DENSITIES 

### ALL SPECIES DENSITIES

These were determined by combining transect areas with fish abundances and so we have one density per species per transect.

## SUBSTRATE

DFO measured habitat continuously in their transects (so every time the habitat changed they recorded that change you so you could calculate the area of each habitat type). The WDFW records the habitat every 30 seconds instead so you really only get these point measures (because habitat could have changed several times in each segment). So I am going to calucate the % habitat of each transect simply by treating each measure as a sample point (e.g. if there were 40, 30 second segments that is 40 habitat measures) and then dividing each type by the total (e.g. 3 records of rock would be 3/40 as the % of rock on that transect) Does this make sense?

Count of substrate 1 per surveyID divided by the total number of records of substrate in that SurveyID but need to do this with the width data csv not the all.data data frame (because that only has the habitats associated with fish)

``` {r}

# plot of the 9 substrate categories (bar plot of mean % and SD)
all.types
```
```{r, echo = F}
# plot of the 9 substrate categories (bar plot of mean % and SD)
ggplot(all.types) + geom_col(aes(x = sub.types, y = mean.percent)) +
    scale_color_fish_d(option = "Cirrhilabrus_solorensis", direction = -1) +  
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  xlab("Substrate types") +
  ylab("% of observations")
       
```

``` {r}

all.types.by.RCA

```
``` {r, echo = F}
# plot of the 9 substrate categories (bar plot of mean % and SD) for IN and OUT RCAs

ggplot(all.types.by.RCA) + geom_col(aes(x = sub.types, y = mean.percent, fill = RCA), position = "dodge") +
