# Preliminary Analysis of Vector ROV surveys from 2018

This includes both data cleaning and calculating abundances of fish
species and their densities using the area of transects. The goal of
this analysis is to determine if there is an effect of RCA status or
habitat type on fish densities. I think that I will need to calculate a
PCA analysis to pair down habitat characterisitics into fewer
catagories.
